In Programmer class add below two public methods: 

	1. List<String> getLanguages() -> will return all languages that programmer knows.
	2. void addLanguage(String language) -> will add a new language to the list of languages that programmer knows.

ProgrammerTeacher class has to inherit Programmer class and override methods and will have one additional public method.

	1. boolean teach(Programmer programmer, String language) -> this method will check if programmer knows the language. 
	If programmer does not know and teacher knows language then teacher teaches and method returns true. 
	If both do not know that language or programmer knows the language then returns false.
	2. Override getLanguages() and addLanguage(String language) methods for teacher. And have separate list for teacher languages.

For example below code shows how ProgrammerTecher teaches a new language to Programmer:

	ProgrammerTeacher teacher = new ProgrammerTeacher();
	teacher.addLanguage("Java");
	
	Programmer programmer = new Programmer();
	teacher.teach(programmer, "Java"); -> will return true as programmer does not know this language and will add to the list of languages of Programmer.
	
		// This for loop should print only Java
		for(String language: programmer.getLanguages()){
		     System.out.println(language);
		}
		
		Output: 
		      Java
